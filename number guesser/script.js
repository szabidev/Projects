/*Create a generateTarget() function. This function will be called at the start of each new round 
in order to generate the new secret target number.
This function should return a random integer between 0 and 9. */

/*Create a compareGuesses() function. This function will be called each round to determine
 which guess is closest to the target number.
This function:
Has three parameters representing the user (human) guess, a computer guess, and the secret target number
 to be guessed.
Determines which player (human or computer) wins based on which guess is closest to the target. 
If both players are tied, the human user should win.
Return true if the human player wins, and false if the computer player wins.
*/

/*
Create an updateScore() function. This function will be used to correctly increase the winnerâ€™s score
 after each round.
This function:
Has a single parameter. This parameter will be a string value representing the winner.
Increases the score variable (humanScore or computerScore) by 1 depending on the winner passed in to 
updateScore. The string passed in will be either 'human' or 'computer'.
Does not need to return any value.
*/

/*
Create an advanceRound() function. This function will be used to update the round number after each round.
advanceRound() should increase the value of currentRoundNumber by 1.
After completing advanceRound(), your Number Guesser game should be fully operational.
 You should be able to make guesses, see your or the computer score increase correctly,
  move to the next round, and see the correct round displayed.
